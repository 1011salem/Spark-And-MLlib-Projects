# Spark-Projects

## About
This repository contains the projects and exercises done by me using Spark on Python. Each folder has the code as well as data associated with that project. All the code should be executable as long as the computer meets the requirements mentioned in the dependencies section.

## Dependencies
To execute my projects you will need a system that satisfies below dependencies. These projects were done on Linux machine so you can use Linux Ubuntu, AWS EC2, AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce) or any cluster distributed computing environment that has spark.
- Python 3.5
- Spark 2.1
- Scala
- Java
- Linux(Ubuntu, AWS EC2, AWS EMR, Databricks Notebook)
